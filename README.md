# BJORN the Cyber Viking – Skin Customization Guide

This guide explains how to reskin the BJORN the Cyber Viking to give it a **Megaman Battle Network**–inspired appearance. The process simply replaces image assets for both the E-ink display and the Web UI.

## Steps to Customize the Skin

1. **Download the Image Files**  
   Download the `images.7z` and `web.7z` archives containing the new skin assets.

2. **Extract the Files**   
   Use your preferred archive tool to extract both `.7z` files.

3. **Replace the Existing Images** 
   - Navigate to the `/bjorn` directory on your Raspberry Pi (or your project location).  
   - When prompted, choose **Overwrite** to replace the existing image files.

4. **Reboot the System** 
   Restart BJORN to apply the new assets. The E-ink display and Web UI should now reflect the Megaman Battle Network theme.
